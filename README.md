# Generic-Web-Classifier

## A Generic Classifier for any image

The goal of the Generic Web Classifier is an upgrade from @Arkidillo and @benfernandez "generic incremental classifier": [Github Repository](https://github.com/Arkidillo/generic-incremental-classifier)

Using LeNet architecture as the convolutional neural network of choice, with Keras and Tensorflow backend, a more accurate, but specified classifier is implemented for the user

Readme will be updated and organized as project progresses...

TODO: find dataset with many images all tagged and original images such that when user asks for a specific *thing* the neural network will test against all pictures not associated with *thing*

TODO: work on scraping online all image searches of the specific *thing* they want

TOOD: essentially, goal is to make this generic and web based
